# `imml`

`imml` (indented markdown markup language) is a markup language and static site generator whose purpose is to create minimalist, blazing fast no-javascript websites from a single, portable plain text file.

The project was born from the desire to have a process to build a personal website which doesn't get more complicated than editing a single text file and calling it a day. Could be the perfect choice for your blog, public brain dump, recipe list, no-fuss portfolio, low-fi zine, or anything you can think of.
